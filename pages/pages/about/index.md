Hi. My name is Jared.

I am a self made nerd. I got into computers after high school when a friend introduced me to Quake Rocket Area. From 
there I enrolled into Computer Science in college. 

This is just a place for me to share some things that I learn and feel that others might benefit from or at least I can
put what I learned on 'paper' and solidify the concepts in my mind.

Outside of the computer world I am a husband, father and a fitness junkie.
 
I hope you get something valuable from my ramblings.
